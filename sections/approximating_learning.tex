\subsection{Worst Case}
\begin{theorem}
    If there is an $\br{O\br{1}, \alpha}$-bicriteria approximation algorithm for PCSC then there is an
$O\br{\alpha \cdot \log n}$-approximation algorithm for PCWCAL.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Average Case}
\begin{theorem}
    If there is a $\beta$- approximation algorithm for PCMSSC then there is an
$O\br{\beta \cdot \log n}$-approximation algorithm for PCACAL.
\end{theorem}
