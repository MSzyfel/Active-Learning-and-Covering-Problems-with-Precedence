\subsection{Binary search with precedence constrains}
\begin{theorem}
    Worst-Case Binary Search With Precedence Constraints is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Consider an instance of \ProblemThreeSat given as: a set of variables $V$, and a set of clauses $C$.
	Each clause consist of exactly $3$ literals.
	Moreover, the variant where any $v \in V$ appears at most $5$ times as $v$ or $\overline{v}$ in the clauses is still \NPcomplete \cite{GareyAndJohnson}. 
	Obviously, in this variant $|C| = \O(|V|)$.
	The idea is to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Divide the line into $2$ modules: variables and clauses. 
		Moreover divide the modules into small segments so each corresponds to a single variable, clause, respectively.
		Use precedence constraints to force this.
		\item All the variables can be queried at once.
		Hence, either the variable or it's negation is quarried in a given turn.
		\item Make every literal dependent on the corresponding variable.
		\item Now, if at least one variable was queried in the time $t$, then at least one literal can be queried in $t+1$.
		\item If at least one literal was queried then a clause gadget can be quaried in a time $t'$, otherwise in greater time. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	More formally, the mapping of an instance of \ProblemThreeSat is as follows.
	To construct the graph:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let $d > 0$ be such a value that $\log_2(|C| + |V| + d) \in Z$.
		Add $d$ dummy variables.
		\item Let a clause $C_i$ be composed of literals $l_i^1, l_i^2, l_i^3$ in any order.
		For every clause $C_i = \{v_i^1, v_i^2, v_i^3\}$, construct a gadget given as a path graph on vertices
		\[
			\coord{C}{i}{1}, \coord{C}{i}{2}, \coord{C}{i}{v_i^1}, \coord{C}{i}{v_i^2}, \coord{C}{i}{v_i^3}, \coord{C}{i}{3}, 	\coord{C}{i}{4}.
		\]
		\item For a variable $v_i$, construct a gadget compose of $3$ vertices as a path
		\[
			\coord{v}{i}{1}, \coord{v}{i}{2}, \coord{v}{i}{3}
		\]
		Denote edge $(\coord{V}{i}{1}, \coord{V}{i}{2})$ as $\ecoord{V}{i}{+}$.
		Denote edge $(\coord{V}{i}{2}, \coord{V}{i}{3})$ as $\ecoord{V}{i}{-}$.
		\item Compose the graph in the following way:
		Connect each clause gadget one by one, by a "separator edge".
		I.e. the vertex $\coord{C}{i}{4}$ is connected to $\coord{C}{i+1}{1}$ $i$-th separator edge.
		Connect $\coord{C}{|C|}{4}$ to $\coord{V}{i}{1}$ by $(i+1)$-th separator edge.
		Continue with variable gadgets in the same way.
	\end{enumerate}
	To define the order on the edges:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item There are exactly $1+2+\ldots+2^{k}$ separator edges.
	\end{enumerate}
