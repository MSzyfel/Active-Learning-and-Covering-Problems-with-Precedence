\subsection{Binary search with precedence constrains}\begin{theorem}
    Worst-Case Binary Search With Precedence Caseonstrains is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
    Average-Case Binary Search With Precedence Caseonstrains is NP-hard.
\end{theorem}
\subsection{Outforest precendce constrains}
\begin{theorem}
    PCWCAL with outforest precedence constraints is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $O\br{\log^2 n}$ unless P = NP.
\end{theorem}
\subsection{General precedence constraints}
\begin{theorem}
    PCWCAL cannot be approximated within a factor of $o\br{m^{1/6}}$ nor $o\br{n^{1/12}}$ condition to Planted Dense Subgraph Conjecture. 
\end{theorem}
