The set-covering problem is to minimize cTx subject to Ax ≥ e and x binary. We compare the value of the objective function at a feasible solution found by a simple greedy heuristic to the true optimum. It turns out that the ratio between the two grows at most logarithmically in the largest column sum of A. When all the components of $c^{T}$ are the same, our result reduces to a theorem established previously by Johnson and Lovasz.},

We give a polynomial-time 8.497α-approximation algorithm for this generalization, where α denotes the best achievable approximation factor for the problem of finding the least-cost rooted tree spanning i vertices of a metric. For the latter problem, a (2 + ε)-approximation is known. Our results can be compared with the best-known approximation algorithm using similar techniques for the case k = 1, which is 3.59α. Moreover, recent work of Chaudry et al. [2003] shows how to remove the factor of α, thus improving all of these results by that factor. We are aware of no previous work on the approximability of the present problem. In addition, we give a simple proof of the 3.59α-approximation result that can be more easily extended to the case of multiple repairmen, and may be of independent interest.},

This problem is NP-hard. For the special case of this problem, where each set has unit cost, a (1−1/e)-approximation is known. Yet, prior to this work, no approximation results were known for the general cost version. The contribution of this paper is a (1−1/e)-approximation algorithm for the budgeted maximum coverage problem.

    abstract = { Decision Tree is a classic formulation of active learning: given n hypotheses with nonnegative weights summing to 1 and a set of tests that each partition the hypotheses, output a decision tree using the provided tests that uniquely identifies each hypothesis and has minimum (weighted) average depth. Previous works showed that the greedy algorithm achieves a O(log n) approximation ratio for this problem and it is NP-hard beat a O(log n) approximation, settling the complexity of the problem. However, for Uniform Decision Tree, i.e. Decision Tree with uniform weights, the story is more subtle. The greedy algorithm's O(log n) approximation ratio was the best known, but the largest approximation ratio known to be NP-hard is 4 – ε. We prove that the greedy algorithm gives a approximation for Uniform Decision Tree, where COPT is the cost of the optimal tree and show this is best possible for the greedy algorithm. As a corollary, we resolve a conjecture of Kosaraju, Przytycka, and Borgstrom [20]. Our results also hold for instances of DecisioN Tree whose weights are not too far from uniform. Leveraging this result, for all α ϵ (0, 1), we exhibit a approximation algorithm to Uniform Decision Tree running in subexponential time . As a corollary, achieving any super-constant approximation ratio on Uniform Decision Tree is not NP-hard, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. This work therefore adds approximating Uniform Decision Tree to a small list of natural problems that have subexponential time algorithms but no known polynomial time algorithms. Like the analysis of the greedy algorithm, our analysis of the subexponential time algorithm gives similar approximation guarantees even for slightly nonuniform weights. A key technical contribution of our work is showing a connection between greedy algorithms for Uniform Decision Tree and for Min Sum Set Cover. }

We show that this problem is equivalent to finding edge ranking of a simple tree corresponding to the Hasse diagram, which implies the existence of a linear-time algorithm for this problem. Then we study a more general problem, namely searching in any partial order with maximum element. We prove that such a generalization is hard, and we give an O(lognlog(logn))-approximate polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.}

  abstract = 	 {Adaptive sequential decision making is one of the central challenges in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In such problems, the goal is to design an interactive policy that plans for an action to take, from a finite set of $n$ actions, given some partial observations. It has been shown that in many applications such as active learning, robotics, sequential experimental design, and active detection, the utility function satisfies adaptive submodularity, a notion that generalizes the notion of diminishing returns to policies.  In this paper, we revisit the power of adaptivity in maximizing an adaptive monotone submodular function. We propose an efficient semi adaptive policy that with $O(\log n \times\log k)$ adaptive rounds of observations can achieve an almost tight $1-1/e-\epsilon$ approximation guarantee with respect to an optimal policy that carries out $k$ actions in a fully sequential manner. To complement our results, we also show that it is impossible to achieve a constant factor approximation with $o(\log n)$ adaptive rounds. We also extend our result to the case of adaptive stochastic minimum cost coverage where the goal is to reach a desired utility $Q$ with the cheapest policy. We first prove the long-standing conjecture by Golovin and Krause and show that the greedy policy achieves the asymptotically tight logarithmic approximation guarantee. We then propose a semi adaptive policy that provides the same guarantee in polylogarithmic adaptive rounds through a similar information-parallelism scheme. Our results shrink the adaptivity gap in adaptive submodular maximization by an exponential factor.}

Our result is the first O(ln Q)-approximation algorithm for this problem. Previously, O(ln Q)-approximation algorithms were only known assuming either independent items or unit-cost items. Furthermore, our result easily extends to the setting where one wants to simultaneously cover multiple adaptive-submodular functions: we obtain the first approximation algorithm for this generalization. }

abstract = {The Binary Identification Problem for weighted trees asks for the minimum cost strategy (decision tree) for identifying a vertex in an edge weighted tree via testing edges. Each edge has assigned a different cost, to be paid for testing it. Testing an edge e reveals in which component of T−e lies the vertex to be identified. We give a complete characterization of the computational complexity of this problem with respect to both tree diameter and degree. In particular, we show that it is strongly NP-hard to compute a minimum cost decision tree for weighted trees of diameter at least 6, and for trees having degree three or more. For trees of diameter five or less, we give a polynomial time algorithm. Moreover, for the degree 2 case, we significantly improve the straightforward O(n3) dynamic programming approach, and provide an O(n2) time algorithm. Finally, this work contains the first approximate decision tree construction algorithm that breaks the barrier of factor logn.}

abstract = {Searching in partially ordered structures has been considered in the context of information retrieval and efficient tree-like indices, as well as in hierarchy based knowledge representation. In this paper we focus on tree-like partial orders and consider the problem of identifying an initially unknown vertex in a tree by asking edge queries: an edge query e returns the component of T−e containing the vertex sought for, while incurring some known cost c(e). The Tree Search Problem with Non-Uniform Cost is the following: given a tree T on n vertices, each edge having an associated cost, construct a strategy that minimizes the total cost of the identification in the worst case. Finding the strategy guaranteeing the minimum possible cost is an NP-complete problem already for input trees of degree 3 or diameter 6. The best known approximation guarantee was an O(log⁡n/log⁡log⁡log⁡n)-approximation algorithm of Cicalese et al. (2012) [4]. We improve upon the above results both from the algorithmic and the computational complexity point of view: We provide a novel algorithm that provides an O(log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n)-approximation of the cost of the optimal strategy. In addition, we show that finding an optimal strategy is NP-hard even when the input tree is a spider of diameter 6, i.e., at most one vertex has degree larger than 2.}

abstract = {We propose an analytical framework for studying parallel repetition, a basic product operation for one-round twoplayer games. In this framework, we consider a relaxation of the value of projection games. We show that this relaxation is multiplicative with respect to parallel repetition and that it provides a good approximation to the game value. Based on this relaxation, we prove the following improved parallel repetition bound: For every projection game G with value at most ρ, the k-fold parallel repetition G⊗k has value at most[EQUATION]This statement implies a parallel repetition bound for projection games with low value ρ. Previously, it was not known whether parallel repetition decreases the value of such games. This result allows us to show that approximating set cover to within factor (1 --- ε) ln n is NP-hard for every ε > 0, strengthening Feige's quasi-NP-hardness and also building on previous work by Moshkovitz and Raz.In this framework, we also show improved bounds for few parallel repetitions of projection games, showing that Raz's counterexample to strong parallel repetition is tight even for a small number of repetitions.Finally, we also give a short proof for the NP-hardness of label cover(1, δ) for all δ > 0, starting from the basic PCP theorem.},
