abstract = {We provide the first hardness result of a polylogarithmic approximation ratio for a natural NP-hard optimization problem. We show that for every fixed ε>0, the GROUP-STEINER-TREE problem admits no efficient log2-ε k approximation, where k denotes the number of groups (or, alternatively, the input size), unless NP has quasi polynomial Las-Vegas algorithms. This hardness result holds even for input graphs which are Hierarchically Well-Separated Trees, introduced by Bartal [FOCS, 1996]. For these trees (and also for general trees), our bound is nearly tight with the log-squared approximation currently known. Our results imply that for every fixed ε>0, the DIRECTED-STEINER TREE problem admits no log2-ε n--approximation, where n is the number of vertices in the graph, under the same complexity assumption.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of constructing decision trees for entity identification from a given relational table. The input is a table containing information about a set of entities over a fixed set of attributes and a probability distribution over the set of entities that specifies the likelihood of the occurrence of each entity. The goal is to construct a decision tree that identifies each entity unambiguously by testing the attribute values such that the average number of tests is minimized. This classical problem finds such diverse applications as efficient fault detection, species identification in biology, and efficient diagnosis in the field of medicine. Prior work mainly deals with the special case where the input table is binary and the probability distribution over the set of entities is uniform. We study the general problem involving arbitrary input tables and arbitrary probability distributions over the set of entities. We consider a natural greedy algorithm and prove an approximation guarantee of O(rK • log N), where N is the number of entities and K is the maximum number of distinct values of an attribute. The value rK is a suitably defined Ramsey number, which is at most log K. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor of Ω(log N), even for binary tables (i.e. K=2). Thus, for the case of binary tables, our approximation algorithm is optimal up to constant factors (since r2=2). In addition, our analysis indicates a possible way of resolving a Ramsey-theoretic conjecture by Erdos.},

abstract = {Given a set of objects O and a set of tests T, the abstract decision tree problem (DTP) is to construct a tree with minimum height that completely identifies the objects of O, by using the tests of T. No algorithm with a good approximation ratio is known to solve this problem. We give a theoretical support for this fact by showing that DTP does not admit an o(log n)-approximation algorithm unless P=NP.}

year = {2014},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {In several applications of automatic diagnosis and active learning a central problem is the evaluation of a discrete function by adaptively querying the values of its variables until the values read uniquely determine the value of the function. In general reading the value of a variable is done at the expense of some cost (computational or possibly a fee to pay the corresponding experiment). The goal is to design a strategy for evaluating the function incurring little cost (in the worst case or in expectation according to a prior distribution on the possible variables' assignments).Our algorithm builds a strategy (decision tree) which attains a logarithmic approximation simultaneously for the expected and worst cost spent. This is best possible since, under standard complexity assumption, no algorithm can guarantee o(log n) approximation.},
