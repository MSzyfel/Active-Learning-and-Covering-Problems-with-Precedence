 abstract = {Let A be a binary matrix of size m × n, let $c^{T}$ be a positive row vector of length n and let e be the column vector, all of whose m components are ones. The set-covering problem is to minimize cTx subject to Ax ≥ e and x binary. We compare the value of the objective function at a feasible solution found by a simple greedy heuristic to the true optimum. It turns out that the ratio between the two grows at most logarithmically in the largest column sum of A. When all the components of $c^{T}$ are the same, our result reduces to a theorem established previously by Johnson and Lovasz.},

abstract = {We consider the k-traveling repairmen problem, also known as the minimum latency problem, to multiple repairmen. We give a polynomial-time 8.497α-approximation algorithm for this generalization, where α denotes the best achievable approximation factor for the problem of finding the least-cost rooted tree spanning i vertices of a metric. For the latter problem, a (2 + ε)-approximation is known. Our results can be compared with the best-known approximation algorithm using similar techniques for the case k = 1, which is 3.59α. Moreover, recent work of Chaudry et al. [2003] shows how to remove the factor of α, thus improving all of these results by that factor. We are aware of no previous work on the approximability of the present problem. In addition, we give a simple proof of the 3.59α-approximation result that can be more easily extended to the case of multiple repairmen, and may be of independent interest.},

abstract = {The budgeted maximum coverage problem is: given a collection S of sets with associated costs defined over a domain of weighted elements, and a budget L, find a subset of S′⫅S such that the total cost of sets in S′ does not exceed L, and the total weight of elements covered by S′ is maximized. This problem is NP-hard. For the special case of this problem, where each set has unit cost, a (1−1/e)-approximation is known. Yet, prior to this work, no approximation results were known for the general cost version. The contribution of this paper is a (1−1/e)-approximation algorithm for the budgeted maximum coverage problem. We also argue that this approximation factor is the best possible, unless NP⫅DTIME(nO(loglogn)).}
